## Roco's Pet Store Proyect.

This was a proyect for the Web Development course of Diego Portales University.

The goal was to make a little e-commerce web page without the real payment implementation using Bootstrap, PHP and MongoDB for the database.

It has Session Control and a special section for the sellers and in the sellers section I made a little Web-Scraping on [Pyk](https://pyk.cl) for the upload of the products but the page admits manual adding of products also.

You cand find the Web-Scraping part [Here](https://github.com/SergioLV/RocoPetStore/blob/master/addprodws.php).

## Important notes

 In order to Web-Scrap [Pyk](https://pyk.cl) I used:

- [PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser](https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/)
